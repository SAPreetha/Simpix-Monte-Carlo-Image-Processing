# Simpix-Monte-Carlo-Image-Processing
Using Monte Carlo, I reorganized the pixels in a source image S, to look like a target image T. This creates a new image Sâ€™ with different colors and looks exactly like the target image T.  

This code use bith Root and C++ libraries. I have included a make file. To execute the code:
$cd ~/simpix/
$make
$simpix one.png two.png 

For this code both pictures need to have same pixel dimesions.
